#  Coronary Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Introduction
 This project aims to predict the likelihood of Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) using Logistic Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. CHD is a serious medical condition and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. By leveraging relevant health indicators, we build a predictive model that can help identify individuals at higher rish of developing CHD.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

## Features 
- Data preprocessing - Code includes essential data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -  It includes visualizations like bar plots and correlation heatmaps to help users understand the data better.

- Backward elimination for feature selection - By calculating P-values for each feature, it automatically removes irrelevant features to improve model efficiency and interpretability.

- Training and testing Logistic regression model - The code splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains the Logistic regression model on the training data and evaluates its performance using accuracy metrics on the test data.
